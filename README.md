# Cbb
Cbb (C𝄫 or C Double Flat) is a C++ music theory library. Cbb attempts to provide abstract data types and utilities that are more inituitive and more flexible than conventional methods of music programming. Ideally, a music savvy programmer will find that Cbb expresses musical concepts in a manner than is much more natural than, say, MIDI note numbers or PPQN rhythms.
